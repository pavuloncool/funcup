# Implementation Plan: funcup — QR-Driven Specialty Coffee Discovery Platform

**Branch**: `002-qr-coffee-platform` | **Date**: 2026-03-25 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-qr-coffee-platform/spec.md`

---

## Summary

Build funcup MVP: a QR-driven specialty coffee discovery platform consisting of (1) an Expo mobile app for consumers to scan batch QR codes, log tastings, and discover coffees, and (2) a Next.js web app for verified roasters to publish coffee profiles, create batches, generate QR codes, and read consumer feedback. Both apps share a single Supabase/PostgreSQL backend with three Edge Functions (scan_qr, generate_qr, update_coffee_stats) and a 13-table schema pre-defined in Notion Data Model v3.

---

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x — `"strict": true` in all `tsconfig.json` files
**Primary Dependencies**:
- Mobile: Expo SDK 52+, expo-camera (QR scan), NativeWind 4, React Native Reanimated 3, TanStack Query v5, @supabase/supabase-js, MMKV (offline queue), expo-secure-store, expo-auth-session, expo-apple-authentication, expo-linking
- Web: Next.js 15 App Router, Framer Motion 11, @supabase/supabase-js, @supabase/ssr, Tailwind CSS 3, qrcode (QR generation in Edge Function)
- Shared (`/packages/shared`): Supabase-generated TypeScript types, TanStack Query hooks, Supabase client factory, flavor notes + brew method constants

**Storage**: Supabase/PostgreSQL (cloud, canonical), MMKV (mobile — offline tasting queue), Supabase Storage (images + QR assets)
**Testing**: Jest + React Native Testing Library (mobile), Vitest + Playwright (web); Supabase local via `supabase start`
**Target Platform**: iOS 16+, Android API 31+ (Expo managed workflow + EAS Build); Web — all modern browsers (Next.js SSR)
**Project Type**: Monorepo — consumer mobile app + roaster web dashboard + shared packages (Turborepo + pnpm workspaces)
**Performance Goals**:
- Coffee Page load ≤ 5 s on standard 4G connection (SC-003)
- Full QR scan → Coffee Page ≤ 5 s (FR-002)
- Offline tasting sync within 30 s of reconnect (SC-005)
- Tasting journal scrollable up to 500 entries without lag (SC-007)
- `coffee_stats` reflect new tastings within 5 min (SC-008)

**Constraints**:
- RLS enabled on all Supabase tables; no publicly writable table without a policy
- Offline-capable mobile: previously cached pages readable; tastings queued locally via MMKV
- Animations ≤ 400 ms, 60 fps on Snapdragon 6xx; `prefers-reduced-motion` respected
- TypeScript strict; `any` banned except third-party wrappers (with inline `// TODO: type this`)
- Supabase-generated types are canonical; hand-written entity interfaces are not permitted
- No `console.log` in production; environment secrets never in client bundles

**Scale/Scope**: 13 DB tables, 3 Edge Functions, ~15 mobile screens, ~10 web screens, MVP launch

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| Principle | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **I. Mobile-First, Coffee-First** | ✅ PASS | Expo is the consumer product; Next.js is the roaster product. Coffee domain language enforced throughout spec (origin, roast, tasting notes, brew method, rating). No generic CRUD labels in user-facing copy. |
| **II. Shared Data Contract** | ✅ PASS | Supabase/PostgreSQL is single source of truth. `supabase gen types typescript` generates canonical types in `/packages/shared/src/types/`. Migrations versioned in `/supabase/migrations/` before any client PR. |
| **III. Dual-Product Architecture** | ✅ PASS | Expo (consumers) + Next.js (roasters) share Supabase backend. UX, navigation, and features are designed independently. Platform-specific code isolated via `.native.tsx` / `.web.tsx` or `Platform.select()`. |
| **IV. Offline-Aware UX** | ✅ PASS | FR-009 mandates offline queue for tastings. US-5 (P5) covers full offline scenario. MMKV + TanStack Query mutation cache + `NetInfo` sync manager. Conflict resolution: server `updated_at` last-write-wins. |
| **V. Animation with Intent** | ✅ PASS | React Native Reanimated 3 (mobile) + Framer Motion 11 (web). All animations ≤ 400 ms. `prefers-reduced-motion` suppresses decorative animations. 60 fps target on mid-range Android. Entry animation protected (Principle IX). |
| **VI. Type-Safe Across the Stack** | ✅ PASS | TypeScript strict mode in all packages. Supabase-generated types as canonical entity definitions. `any` policy enforced via ESLint rule. |
| **VII. QR-First Interaction** | ✅ PASS | QR scanner is primary entry point (FR-001); Coffee Page loads within 5 s (FR-002). Scan Coffee is visually dominant CTA in Coffee Hub (FR-006). All mobile features designed around the scan moment. |
| **VIII. Separation of Roles** | ✅ PASS | FR-021 enforces: roasters write product data, consumers write sensory data. RLS policies enforce this at DB level. Verified-roaster check in Edge Functions + Supabase policies. |
| **IX. Entry Interaction — Tap to Bean** | ✅ PASS | FR-012 protects the splash screen. Zero engineering effort in this plan. No implementation task touches entry animation flow. |

**Gate result: ALL PASS — proceed to Phase 0.**

**Structure Decision**: Monorepo (Option 3 extended) with Turborepo + pnpm workspaces. `/apps/mobile` and `/apps/web` are fully independent products; `/packages/shared` holds only platform-agnostic code. `/supabase` is at repo root per Supabase CLI convention.
