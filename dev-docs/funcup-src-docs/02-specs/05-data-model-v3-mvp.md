# ├ 05 Data Model v3 (MVP)   
# **Purpose:**   
Define the relational database structure for the funcup platform MVP.   
This model translates the **Information Architecture** into a concrete schema that backend developers can implement.   
The model is designed for:   
- PostgreSQL   
- Supabase backend   
- mobile-first architecture   
- scalability for future analytics.   
 --- 
   
# 1. Data Model Principles   
The funcup database follows several guiding principles.   
### Product identity first   
Coffee identity is structured as:   
```
Roaster → Coffee → Roast Batch → QR Code
```
This ensures that **each physical coffee bag can be uniquely identified**.   
 --- 
### Experience-driven data   
Consumer data is structured around **coffee logs**:   
```
User → Coffee Log → Flavor Notes / Review / Brew Method
```
The coffee log represents the **moment of consumption**.   
 --- 
### Structured sensory data   
Flavor descriptors and brew methods use **controlled vocabularies** rather than free text.   
This allows:   
- aggregation   
- analytics   
- discovery features.   
 ---

# 9. MVP Scope   
The MVP version focuses on the minimum viable dataset required to enable:   
```
scan coffee
log experience
rate coffee
discover coffees
```
Core MVP tables:   
```
users
roasters
origins
coffees
roast_batches
qr_codes
coffee_logs
reviews

# 10. Guiding Principle   
The funcup data model follows a simple rule:   
```
Coffee identity must be precise.
Consumer experience must be structured.
Discovery must be data-driven.
```
This structure enables funcup to become a **global dataset of real coffee experiences**.
